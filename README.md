# Webtoon_scraping

Goals: 
- create a scraper that collects data of webtoons for a set period of time (probably every hour or every half hour?).
- Desired columns: (time, genre, webtoon name, webtoon views, webtoon rating, webtoon subscribers)
- create a library to scrape webtoons, evaluate what genre's are the most popular? What genre's are posted most?
